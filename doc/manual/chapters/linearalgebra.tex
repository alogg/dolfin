\chapter{Linear algebra}

\devnote{Since this chapter was written, the \dolfin{} linear algebra
  interface has undergone some changes that are not documented here.
  As a result, some of the information in this chapter may be
  outdated, incomplete or simply wrong.}

\dolfin{} provides a high-performance linear algebra library,
including matrices and vectors, a set of linear solvers,
preconditioners, and an eigenvalue solver. The core part of the
functionality is provided through a wrappers that provide a common
interface to the functionality of the linear algebra libraries
uBlas~\cite{www:ublas} and PETSc~\cite{www:petsc}.

\section{Matrices and vectors}
\index{\texttt{Matrix}}
\index{\texttt{Vector}}

The two basic linear algebra data structures are the classes
\texttt{Matrix} and \texttt{Vector}, representing a sparse $M\times
N$ matrix and a vector of length $N$ respectively.

The following code demonstrates how to create a matrix and a vector:
\begin{code}
Matrix A(M, N);
Vector x(N);
\end{code}
Alternatively, the matrix and the vector may be created by
\begin{code}
Matrix A;
Vector x;

A.init(M, N);
x.init(N);
\end{code}

The following code demonstrates how to access the size and the
elements of a matrix and a vector:
\begin{code}
A(5, 5) = 1.0;
real a = A(4, 3);

x(3) = 2.0;
real b = x(5);

unsigned int M = A.size(0);
unsigned int N = A.size(1);

N = x.size();
\end{code}

In addition, \dolfin{} provides optimized functions for setting the
values of a set of entries in a matrix or vector:
\begin{code}
real block[] = {2, 4, 6};
int rows[] = {0, 1, 2};
int cols[] = {0, 1, 2};
  
A.set(block, rows, cols, 3);
\end{code}
Alternatively, the set of values given by the array \texttt{block} can
be added to the entries given by the arrays \texttt{rows} and
\texttt{cols}:
\begin{code}
real block[] = {2, 4, 6};
int rows[] = {0, 1, 2};
int cols[] = {0, 1, 2};
  
A.add(block, rows, cols, 3);
\end{code}
These functions are particularly useful for efficient assembly of a (sparse)
matrix from a bilinear form.

\subsection{Sparse matrices}
\index{sparse matrix}

The default \dolfin{} class \texttt{Matrix} is a sparse matrix, which
efficiently represents the discretization of a partial differential
equation where most entries in the matrix are zero. Alternatively,
the class \texttt{SparseMatrix} may be used which is identical with
the class \texttt{Matrix}\footnote{The class \texttt{Matrix} is a
\texttt{typedef} for the class \texttt{SparseMatrix}.}.

If \dolfin{} has been compiled with support for PETSc, then the sparse
matrix is represented as a sparse PETSc matrix\footnote{By default, the
sparse matrix is represented as a PETSc \texttt{MATSEQAIJ} matrix, but
other PETSc representations are also available.}. Alternatively, the
class \texttt{PETScMatrix} may be used, together with the corresponding
class \texttt{PETScVector}.

If \dolfin{} has been compiled without support for PETSc, then the
sparse matrix is represented as a uBlas sparse matrix. Alternatively,
the class \texttt{uBlasSparseMatrix} may be used, together with the
corresponding class \texttt{uBlasVector}.

\subsection{Dense matrices}
\index{dense matrix}

\dolfin{} provides the class \texttt{DenseMatrix} for representation
of dense matrices. A dense matrix representation is often preferable
when computing with matrices of small to moderate size. In particular,
accessing individual elements 
is more efficient with a dense matrix representation.

A \texttt{DenseMatrix} is represented as uBlas dense matrix and
alternatively the class \texttt{uBlasDenseMatrix} may be used,
together with the corresponding class \texttt{uBlasVector}.

\subsection{The common interface}
\index{\texttt{GenericMatrix}}
\index{\texttt{GenericVector}}

Although \dolfin{} differentiates between sparse and dense data
structures, the two classes \texttt{GenericMatrix} and
\texttt{GenericVector} define a common interface to all matrices and
vectors. Refer to the \emph{DOLFIN programmer's reference} for the
exact specification of these interfaces.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Solving linear systems}
\index{linear systems}

\dolfin{} provides a set of efficient solvers for linear systems of
the form
\begin{equation}
  Ax = b,
\end{equation}
where $A$ is an $N\times N$ matrix and where $x$ and $b$ are vectors
of length $N$. Both iterative (Krylov subspace) solvers and direct
(LU) solvers are provided.

\subsection{Iterative methods}
\index{iterative methods}
\index{\texttt{GMRES}}
\index{GMRES method}
\index{\texttt{KrylovSolver}}
\index{Krylov subspace methods}

A linear system may be solved by the GMRES Krylov method as follows:
\begin{code}
Matrix A;
Vector x, b:

GMRES::solve(A, x, b);
\end{code}
Alternatively, the linear system may be solved by first creating an
object of the class \texttt{KrylovSolver}, which is more efficient for
repeated solution of linear systems and also allows the specification
of both the Krylov method and the preconditioner:
\begin{code}
KrylovSolver solver(gmres, ilu);
solver.solve(A, x, b);
\end{code}

For uBlas matrices and vectors, the class \texttt{uBlasKrylovSolver}
may be used and for PETSc matrices and vectors, the class
\texttt{PETScKrylovSolver} may be used.

\subsubsection{Krylov methods}
\index{conjugate gradient method}
\index{BiCGStab}

\dolfin{} provides the following set of Krylov methods:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\texttt{cg}              & The conjugate gradient method \\
\hline
\texttt{gmres}           & The GMRES method \\
\hline
\texttt{bicgstab}        & The stabilized biconjugate gradient squared
method \\
\hline
\texttt{default\_method} & Default choice of Krylov method \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Preconditioners}
\index{preconditioners}
\index{ILU}
\index{incomplete LU factorization}
\index{SOR}
\index{successive over-relaxation}
\index{Jacobi}
\index{AMG}
\index{algebraic multigrid}

\dolfin{} provides the following set of preconditioners:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\texttt{none}        & No preconditioning \\
\hline
\texttt{jacobi}      & Simple Jacobi preconditioning \\
\hline
\texttt{sor}         & SOR, successive over-relaxation \\
\hline
\texttt{ilu}         & Incomplete LU factorization \\
\hline
\texttt{icc}         & Incomplete Cholesky factorization \\
\hline
\texttt{amg}         & Algebraic multigrid (through Hypre when available) \\
\hline
\texttt{default\_pc} & Default choice of preconditioner \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Matrix-free solvers}
\index{matrix-free solvers}
\index{virtual matrix}

The \dolfin{} Krylov solvers may be used without direct access to a
matrix representation. All that is needed is to provide the
size of the linear system, the right-hand side, and a method
implementing the multiplication of the matrix with any given vector.

Such a ``virtual matrix'' may be defined by implementing the
interface defined by either the class \texttt{uBlasKrylovMatrix} of
\texttt{PETScKrylovMatrix}. The matrix may then be used together with
either the class \texttt{uBlasKrylovSolver} or \texttt{PETScKrylovSolver}.

\subsection{Direct methods}
\index{\texttt{LU}}
\index{\texttt{LUSolver}}
\index{direct methods}
\index{LU factorization}

A linear system may be solved by a direct LU factorization as follows:
\begin{code}
Matrix A;
Vector x, b;
  
LU::solve(A, x, b);
\end{code}
Alternatively, the linear system may be solved by first creating an
object of the class \texttt{LUSolver}, which may be more efficient for
repeated solution of linear systems:
\begin{code}
LUSolver solver;
solver.solve(A, x, b);
\end{code}

For uBlas matrices and vectors, the class \texttt{uBlasLUSolver} may
be used and for PETSc matrices and vectors, the class
\texttt{PETScLUSolver} may be used.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Solving eigenvalue problems}
\index{eigenvalue problems}
\index{SLEPc}

\dolfin{} also provides a solver for eigenvalue problems\index{eigenvalue solver}. 
The solver is only available when \dolfin{} has been compiled with support for 
PETSc and SLEPc~\cite{www:slepc}.

For the basic eigenvalue problem
%
\begin{equation}
  Ax = \lambda x,
\end{equation}
%
the following code demonstrates how to compute the zeroth eigenpair:
%
\begin{code} 
SLEPcEigenvalueSolver esolver; 
esolver.solve(A);

real lr, lc;
PETScVector xr, xc;
esolver.getEigenpair(lr, lc, xr, xc, 0);
\end{code} 
%
The real and complex components of the eigenvalue are returned in \texttt{lr}
and \texttt{lc}, respectively, and the real and complex parts of the eigenvector
are returned in \texttt{xr} and \texttt{xc}, respectively.

For the generalized eigenvalue problem
\begin{equation}
 A x = \lambda B x,
\end{equation}
the following code demonstrates how to compute the second eigenpair:
\begin{code} 
PETScEigenvalueSolver esolver; 
esolver.solve(A, B);

real lr, lc;
PETScVector xr, xc;
esolver.getEigenpair(lr, lc, xr, xc, 2);
\end{code}

\section{Linear algebra backends}
\index{linear algebra backends}

\subsection{uBlas}
\index{uBlas}

uBlas is a C++ template library that provides BLAS level 1, 2 and 3
functionality (and more) for dense, packed and sparse matrices.
The design and implementation unify mathematical notation via operator
overloading and efficient code generation via expression templates.

\dolfin{} wrappers for uBlas linear algebra is provided through the
classes \texttt{uBlasSparseMatrix}, \texttt{uBlasDenseMatrix} and
\texttt{uBlasVector}. These classes are implemented by subclassing the
corresponding uBlas classes, which means that all standard
\texttt{uBlas} operations are supported for these classes. For
advanced usage not covered by the common \dolfin{} interface specified
by the classes \texttt{GenericMatrix} and \texttt{GenericVector},
refer directly to the documentation of \texttt{uBlas}.
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{PETSc}
\index{PETSc}

PETSc is a suite of data structures and routines for the scalable
(parallel) solution of scientific applications modeled by partial
differential equations. It employs the MPI standard for all 
message-passing communication.

\dolfin{} wrappers for PETSc linear algebra is provided through the
classes \texttt{PETScMatrix} and \texttt{PETScVector}. Direct access
to the PETSc data structures is available through the member functions
\texttt{mat()} and \texttt{vec()}, which return the PETSc \texttt{Mat}
and \texttt{Vec} pointers respectively. For advanced usage not covered
by the common \dolfin{} interface specified by the classes
\texttt{GenericMatrix} and \texttt{GenericVector}, refer directly to
the documentation of PETSc.
